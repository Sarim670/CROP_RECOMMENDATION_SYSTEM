🌾 Crop Recommendation System-

The Crop Recommendation System is a data-driven machine learning project that suggests the most suitable crops for cultivation based on various soil and environmental conditions. It aims to help farmers and agricultural professionals make informed decisions to enhance productivity and sustainability in farming.

🚀 Features
✅ Recommends ideal crops based on user input (N, P, K, temperature, humidity, pH, rainfall)

📊 Uses machine learning models for accurate prediction

📈 Trained on real-world agricultural dataset

🌍 Promotes efficient use of resources and better yield outcomes

💻 Simple and interactive user interface using Streamlit (or web-based if applicable)

🧠 Technologies Used

👉Python for data processing and machine learning

👉Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation

👉Scikit-learn for model training and evaluation

👉Matplotlib / Seaborn for data visualization

👉Streamlit (if applicable) for building the web interface

📂 Dataset
The dataset used includes features like:

~Nitrogen (N)

~Phosphorus (P)

~Potassium (K)

~Temperature

~Humidity

~pH value

~Rainfall

Each row corresponds to conditions favorable for a particular crop.

Dataset Source: 
Kaggle - Crop Recommendation Dataset

🧪 Model Training

Preprocessing: Data cleaning and normalization

Algorithms tried: Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, KNN

Best Model: Random Forest Classifier (due to high accuracy and low overfitting)

Evaluation: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Cross-validation


📈 Future Improvements

Integration with real-time weather API

Multilingual support for farmers across regions
